## Description
**Tracker** is a full-stack Java web app for managing IT/software issues and bugs. It's built on Java/JEE, JSF/Primefaces,
Spring, JPA/Hibernate, and PostgreSQL. The application is designed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) approach to web apps as well as other well-established object-oriented design patterns.

### Features

- Create, update, and delete an issue/bug
- Assign issues/bugs to various team members
- Workflow an issue/bug through the SDLC process
- Create, update, and delete a project
- Create and update a user account
- List, filter, and find issues/bugs
- List, filter, and find projects

### Technologies
- Back-end: Java/JEE, JPA/Hibernate/JDBC/SQL, Spring, JUnit
- Front End: JSF, JSTL, PrimeFaces, HTML, CSS
- Default app server: Tomcat
- Default DB server: PostgreSQL

## Install
There is <a href="#key-features">Video Demo</a> and <a href="http://jentrent.com/tracker" target="_blank">Live Site</a>. To setup and run the project yourself, use the following:

### Dependencies

- Java 8 or higher
- Maven
- Java web app server
- PostgreSQL database server

### Setup
1. Create a postgres user account for DB access. 
2. Log into postgres and run the Tracker DB create script [`tracker_create.sql`](src/main/resources/sql/tracker_create.sql)
3. Add the DB account/pw to the Test [`persistence.xml`](src/test/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml)
4. Add the DB account/pw to the main deployment [`persistence.xml`](src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml)
5. Build the application using `mvn clean install`
6. Deploy the `target/tracker-1.0.war' to your app server.

The build will run the complete set of [JUnit Tests](src/test/java/com/jentrent/tracker/service/test/) verify the setup is working as expected. To skip the tests, add the following to the maven build command:  `-Dmaven.test.skip=true`

### Data Seeder
A [`Data Seeder`](src/test/java/com/jentrent/tracker/seed/DataSeeder.java) is provided that loads the DB with the appropriate data (Issues, Projects, Accounts) to enable the viewing and use of Tracker for evaluation purposes. To run the process, using the following: `mvn exec:java`

## Future Features
There are a number of future features that will be added to Tracker, including the following:
- Ability to add notes to an issue, including screenprints and updates
- Email notifications for assigned issues and tracking status changes
- Rest API for all entity CRUD operations
- Web look-and-feel updates, including styling
